# WxPathfinder
Pathfinder is an Open-Source Photo Mapping Tool designed to extract metadata from Photos and plot them on a leaflet map.

This is a project by me to fulfill the project requirements for the Master's of Science degree in Digital Forensics at Sam Houston State University.

This tool is designed in Python 3.6 version and uses a variety of libraries available through pip install and are also Open-Source.

Libraries included are:
1. Folium (Mapping Library)
2. Leaflet Routing Machine (Designed and developed by Per Liedman)
3. Python Imaging Library (PIL)
4. WxPython (GUI Framework)
5. Geocoder (Geocoding service Library)
6. OpenRouteService (Needed for Routing Machine; Developed by the GIScience Research Group)
7. Variety of Python Native Libraries (OS, Time, Threading, SQLite3, etc.)

This program is not currently licensed under any particular license but other libraries are. Please see the links below in credits for their respective licenses.
